## About

Repository is split into these important parts:

| Directory | Purpose                              |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| home      | Config files from $HOME              |
| setup     | Scripts to run during computer setup |
| scripts   | Runtime scripts under $PATH          |

## Installation

You probably don't want to actually install all my dotfilesâ€¦
So this section is mostly for my future self :\) .

Install project dependencies:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

Install project system-wide:

```bash
make install
```

Or just run everything mentioned (and more):

```bash
make
```
